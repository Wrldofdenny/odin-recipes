# Odin Recipes

This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. 

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a basic recipe website using only HTML. The website will consist of:
- A main index page with links to individual recipes.
- Separate pages for each recipe with a description, list of ingredients, and cooking instructions.

## Skills Demonstrated
By completing this project, I will demonstrate the following skills:
- Structuring a simple HTML document.
- Linking pages within a website.
- Using relative paths for navigation.
- Writing semantic HTML.

## Reflection
Upon completion, I will revisit this README to reflect on what I learned and how I applied the skills.
